# Sattimers

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.2.

01 Dec 2024 Having realised that the new pages will have to be served from the SR servers I needed a
way to test locally using static pages before copying everything to the SR boxes. You guessed it, the continuous
improvers have been at it again and with Angular 19 the 'src/assets' folder which contains the static test data
is completely ignored. No clue why, no clue as to even look to find out what they have broken. 
So once gain the continuous improvers have wasted hours of my valuable time due to their pointless changes.
I eventually got the static test data to load by putting the assets folder into a 'public' folder
which was created when I initialized the project using the command I found via google (of course there is
nothing in the Angular docs about how to setup a new application using the tools)

30 Nov 2024 Had the stupid idea to convert the very old timer listing and edit pages used to program
recordings my Enigma2 based satellite receivers (SR) to Angular. The original pages use 'Ajax' to obtain a list
of recordings, known as 'timers', in JSON format. I remember nothing of 'Ajax' and the pages are 
very awkward to use on a mobile phone and I've just installed a new satellite receiver which required
tweaks to the code so I thought now would be a good time to update the pages. Big laugh! Once again
Angular has changed and nothing is as it was last time I setup a new project (about 3 months ago).
Nonetheless I managed to get the framework in place in a couple of hours - so much random boilerplate!

The idea was to have a single, centrally located, set of pages which would query the receivers to get the
timer information via the web service api. BAD IDEA! Forking CORS prevents that from working - no way to
make a query from a page at server X to a web api at server Y unless something is changed on server Y.
I have no way to modify the OpenWebIf server code to force it to provide the CORS shirt necessary - so
once again normal people just truing to do perfectly legitimate things are shafted in the interest 
of so called 'security'.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
